### Multi-Tenancy Rules

1. **Every table** (except `organizations`) has `organization_id`
2. **Every query** must filter by `organization_id`
3. **Middleware** extracts `org_id` from JWT and attaches to request
4. **Row-Level Security**: Salon A can NEVER see Salon B's data

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-08 | PostgreSQL + Prisma | Relational data, strong typing, easy migrations |
| 2026-01-08 | organization_id on all tables | Simple multi-tenancy, easy to query, performant |
| 2026-01-08 | JWT for auth | Stateless, works well with multi-tenant |
| 2026-01-08 | Stripe for payments | Industry standard, handles subscriptions + POS |
