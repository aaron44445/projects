## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

From v1.0 (affecting v1.1 work):
- Defense-in-depth salonId filtering on all queries
- Advisory locks for booking concurrency
- Insert-or-conflict idempotency for webhooks

From v1.1 Phase 13:
- Use Zod superRefine for conditional production-only validation (13-01)
- Fail fast in production with stderr messages and exit code 1 (13-01)
- Zod refinement chain for password validation with granular error messages (13-02)
- Shared validation logic between frontend and backend for consistency (13-02)
- Return 404 for unauthorized file access to prevent enumeration attacks (13-03)
- Database-authoritative ownership verification, not path-based checks (13-03)
- Audit logging for suspicious file access with full context (13-03)

From v1.1 Phase 14:
- 5-second polling interval for notification jobs (14-01)
- Database-based queue instead of external message broker (14-01)
- 3 retry attempts with pending status reset on failure (14-01)
- 5-minute stale job recovery for crash scenarios (14-01)
- Single Promise.all for all dashboard queries instead of sequential (14-02)
- vipClients placeholder until Client.tags schema field added (14-02)
- Disable background polling with refetchIntervalInBackground: false (14-03)
- Keep refetchOnWindowFocus: true for immediate refresh on tab return (14-03)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Pre-existing TypeScript build errors in subscription-related files (unrelated to phase 13 work)
