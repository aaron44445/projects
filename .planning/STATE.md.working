## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

From v1.0 (affecting v1.1 work):
- Defense-in-depth salonId filtering on all queries
- Advisory locks for booking concurrency
- Insert-or-conflict idempotency for webhooks

From v1.1 Phase 13:
- Use Zod superRefine for conditional production-only validation (13-01)
- Fail fast in production with stderr messages and exit code 1 (13-01)
- Zod refinement chain for password validation with granular error messages (13-02)
- Shared validation logic between frontend and backend for consistency (13-02)
- Return 404 for unauthorized file access to prevent enumeration attacks (13-03)
- Database-authoritative ownership verification, not path-based checks (13-03)
- Audit logging for suspicious file access with full context (13-03)

From v1.1 Phase 14:
- 5-second polling interval for notification jobs (14-01)
- Database-based queue instead of external message broker (14-01)
- 3 retry attempts with pending status reset on failure (14-01)
- 5-minute stale job recovery for crash scenarios (14-01)
- Single Promise.all for all dashboard queries instead of sequential (14-02)
- vipClients placeholder until Client.tags schema field added (14-02)
- Disable background polling with refetchIntervalInBackground: false (14-03)
- Keep refetchOnWindowFocus: true for immediate refresh on tab return (14-03)
- Use PostgreSQL String[] array type with default([]) for tags field (14-04)
- Query VIP clients using Prisma has filter on tags array (14-04)
- Add VIP count to existing Promise.all for zero-overhead parallel execution (14-04)

From v1.1 Phase 15:
- Use Next.js native MetadataRoute convention instead of static files (15-01)
- Block all authenticated routes from crawling via robots.txt (15-01)
- Set homepage priority to 1.0, signup/pricing to 0.8 (15-01)
- Use NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL env var with peacase.com fallback (15-01)
- Use metadataBase with alternates.canonical for automatic canonical URLs (15-02)
- Render JSON-LD in client component body (valid for Google parsing) (15-02)
- Hardcoded schema data is safe for inserting as HTML (15-02)

From v1.1 Phase 16:
- Added sr-only class following standard Tailwind pattern (16-03)
- Used aria-pressed for date button toggle state (16-03)
- Combined date label with selection state in aria-label (16-03)
- Use aria-live=polite instead of assertive for non-urgent announcements (16-02)
- Include availability status in time slot aria-labels for efficient scanning (16-02)
- Announce selection confirmation in live region for immediate feedback (16-02)
