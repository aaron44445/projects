# Plan 11-01: Comprehensive Settings Functionality Audit

## Goal
Audit every button, toggle, dropdown, and input field in the settings section to document what works and what doesn't.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Scan Settings Page Structure
**File:** `apps/web/src/app/settings/page.tsx`

Identify all settings sections/tabs:
- Account
- Business Info
- Staff/Team
- Notifications
- Billing
- Any other sections

Document the structure in SETTINGS-AUDIT.md.

### Task 2: Audit Each Settings Section

For each section, examine every interactive element:

**For each control, document:**
1. Control type (button, toggle, input, dropdown, etc.)
2. Label/description
3. Associated function/handler
4. API endpoint called (if any)
5. Database field updated (if any)
6. Status: WORKING / NOT WORKING / PARTIALLY WORKING
7. Notes on any issues found

**Categories to check:**
- onClick handlers exist and are wired up
- API calls are made with correct endpoints
- Success/error feedback is shown
- State updates correctly after action
- Data persists after page refresh

### Task 3: Create SETTINGS-AUDIT.md

**File:** `.planning/SETTINGS-AUDIT.md`

Structure:
```markdown
# Settings Functionality Audit

## Summary
- Total controls audited: X
- Working: X
- Not Working: X
- Partially Working: X

## Account Settings
| Control | Type | Handler | API | Status | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|-----|--------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Business Info Settings
| Control | Type | Handler | API | Status | Notes |
...

## Staff/Team Settings
...

## Notification Settings
...

## Billing Settings
...
```

### Task 4: Identify Patterns

Look for common issues:
- Buttons with no handlers
- Handlers that don't call APIs
- APIs that don't save to database
- Missing error handling
- Missing success feedback
- State not refreshing after save

## Verification

1. SETTINGS-AUDIT.md exists and is complete
2. Every visible control in settings is documented
3. Status categorization is accurate (verified by code inspection)
4. Notes explain why something is broken (if applicable)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All settings sections documented
- [ ] Every interactive control categorized
- [ ] Clear WORKING/NOT WORKING/PARTIALLY WORKING status
- [ ] Actionable notes for broken items
- [ ] Summary statistics at top of audit

## Output

`.planning/SETTINGS-AUDIT.md` - Complete audit document
